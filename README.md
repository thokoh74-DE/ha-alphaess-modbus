Local Home Assistant integration for **AlphaESS solar inverters** (SMILE-M5, SMILE5, SMILE-G3, SMILE-Hi, SMILE-B3 series) via **Modbus TCP**.

No cloud account required. All communication is direct to the inverter on your local network.

Based on the excellent YAML package by [Axel Koegler](https://projects.hillviewlodge.ie/alphaess/).

## Features

- **103 sensor entities enabled by default** (172 total) - real-time power flows, battery SoC/SoH, cell voltages, temperatures, voltages, energy totals, daily energy summaries, dispatch diagnostics, grid safety parameters, faults & warnings
- **Force Charging** - charge battery from grid at configurable power (kW), duration, and cutoff SoC
- **Force Charging Hold** - keeps Force Charging running indefinitely after the duration expires; turn on before starting Force Charging for continuous charging without a time limit
- **Force Discharging** - discharge battery at configurable power, duration, and cutoff SoC; automatically stops 1% above the cutoff and resets dispatch so the inverter returns to self-consumption without any grid draw
- **Force Discharging Hold** - keeps Force Discharging running for the full configured duration instead of stopping early when the SoC target is reached
- **Force Export** - export to grid at a target feed-in rate (kW); battery discharge is dynamically adjusted for live house load and PV so the grid sees the configured power; stops automatically when the duration expires or battery reaches the cutoff SoC
- **Force Export Hold** - keeps Force Export running indefinitely after the duration expires; turn on before starting Force Export for continuous export without a time limit
- **Automatic dispatch reset on shutdown / restart** - when Home Assistant shuts down or the integration is reloaded, any active Force Export / Import / Charging dispatch is automatically stopped and the inverter returns to self-consumption mode; no manual reset needed after a reboot
- **Force Import** - import from grid at a configurable target kW, dynamically adjusting battery charge to offset live PV so total grid draw stays at the target; stops at cutoff SoC
- **Force Import Hold** - keeps Force Import running indefinitely after the duration expires; turn on before starting Force Import for continuous importing without a time limit
- **Excess Export** - charge the battery with PV power that would otherwise be clipped by the inverter AC output limit; automatically pauses when the house starts drawing from the grid and resumes once PV recovers
- **Dispatch PV Enabled** - enable or disable the inverter's PV coupling during an active dispatch (useful for shedding solar in negative-price periods); defaults to on (PV enabled). Toggling it while a dispatch is running applies immediately; otherwise it takes effect on the next dispatch
- **Battery cell health** - min/max cell voltages polled every 60 s; charge/discharge cutoff voltages, module count, capacity, and type available as diagnostic sensors
- **Dispatch diagnostics** - energy flow direction (human-readable), PV switch state, frequency dispatch flag, power, and frequency
- **Charging / Discharging time periods** - configure up to two charge and discharge windows
- **Dispatch mode selector** - Battery only, SoC Control, Load Following, Maximise Output, and more
- **Max Feed to Grid** - set grid export limit as % of installed PV capacity
- **Date & Time sync** - sync inverter clock to Home Assistant system time
- **Sync Dispatch State** - reconcile HA switch states with the inverter after a restart

## Requirements

- AlphaESS inverter with **Modbus TCP enabled** on port 502
- Inverter reachable on your local network (wired LAN or powerline recommended)
- Home Assistant **2024.10 or newer**
- HACS installed

---

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations** → click the three-dot menu → **Custom Repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/senalse/ha-alphaess-modbus` - category: **Integration**
4. Click **Download** on the AlphaESS Modbus TCP card
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/senalse/ha-alphaess-modbus/releases)
2. Copy the `custom_components/alphaess_modbus` folder into your HA config directory under `custom_components/`
3. Restart Home Assistant

---

## Setup

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**
2. Search for **AlphaESS Modbus TCP**
3. Fill in the details:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Inverter IP Address | - | Use a DHCP reservation for a stable address |
| Modbus Port | `502` | Change only if you've modified the inverter setting |
| Slave ID | `85` | Standard for AlphaESS inverters |

4. Click **Submit** - Home Assistant will test the connection before saving

### Multiple Inverters

To run two AlphaESS inverters with the same Home Assistant instance:

1. Add the integration a second time: **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**, search for **AlphaESS Modbus TCP**, and enter the second inverter's IP address.
2. Immediately rename each device so entity IDs reflect the device name: **Settings → Devices & Services → [device] → pencil icon**. For example, rename one to "AlphaESS Roof" and the other to "AlphaESS Garage".
3. Home Assistant updates all entity IDs automatically - `sensor.alphaess_inverter_*` becomes `sensor.alphaess_roof_*` and `sensor.alphaess_garage_*`.
4. Each integration instance maintains its own Modbus TCP connection. The inverter one-connection limit applies per device - the two instances do not share a connection and do not interfere with each other.

## Poll Intervals

Each sensor has a base poll interval. The coordinator runs a master loop (2 s by default); contiguous registers due in the same cycle are batched into a single Modbus read. Individual registers are skipped when their own `scan_interval` hasn't elapsed yet.

The base intervals in the table below are the minimum achievable intervals. A register can only be read when the master loop fires, so in Normal mode (2 s loop) the effective floor is 2 s -- the 1 s entries are only read every 1 s when Fast mode is active. Actual intervals also scale with the Poll Mode multiplier (see [Poll Speed](#poll-speed) below).

| Base Interval | Sensors |
|---------------|---------|
| **1 s** | Grid Power, Battery Power, Active Power PV Meter, PV String 1–4 Power, PV Total Power *(disabled by default)* |
| **5 s** | Grid Power Phase A/B/C, Grid Voltage Phase A/B/C, Inverter Work Mode, Inverter Power L1/L2/L3 + total, System Fault, Inverter Warning 1/2, Inverter Fault 1/2, Battery Warning/Fault, Max Feed to Grid, Dispatch registers (including Dispatch Energy Flow Direction, Freq Dispatch Flag), dispatch PV switch, freq dispatch power/frequency *(last two disabled by default)* |
| **10 s** | Battery SoC, Battery SoH, Battery min/max cell temps, Battery max charge/discharge current, Charging Time Period Control, Charging Cutoff SoC |
| **30 s** | Grid Frequency, Charging/Discharging period start/stop times, Discharging Cutoff SoC |
| **60 s** | Inverter Temperature, Battery Voltage/Current/Status, Battery min/max cell voltages, Battery Remaining Time *(disabled)*, Battery relay status *(disabled)*, PV String Voltage & Current, Energy Totals, Version strings, Grid safety registers (OVP/UVP/OFP/UFP) *(disabled)*, Network settings *(disabled)* |
| **300 s** | Battery charge/discharge cutoff voltages, Battery module count, Battery capacity, Battery type *(all disabled by default)* |

### Poll Speed

The integration offers three poll speed presets, configurable via the integration's **Configure** button in Settings → Devices & Services:

| Preset | Coordinator loop | Scan interval multiplier | Use case |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------------|----------|
| Slow | 2 s | 3.0 (configurable) | RS485 converters prone to timeouts; reduces Modbus transaction rate |
| Normal | 2 s | 1.0 (fixed) | Default; suitable for wired LAN |
| Fast | 1 s | 0.5 (configurable) | Tighter real-time control (Excess Export, SoC cutoffs); roughly doubles transaction rate |

The Slow and Fast multipliers can be adjusted in the options form (range 0.25-10.0, step 0.25). Fast mode on low-spec hardware (Raspberry Pi 3 or similar) may impact Home Assistant performance due to the increased polling rate.

### Model Variants

The integration supports two model variants, configurable via the integration's **Configure** button in Settings → Devices & Services:

| Variant | Inverter models |
|---------|----------------|
| Standard | All AlphaESS models except B3/B3PLUS (default) |
| SMILE-B3 / SMILE-B3-PLUS | SMILE-B3 and SMILE-B3-PLUS only |

B3 and B3PLUS inverters report some registers with different scale factors. Selecting the wrong variant will show incorrect values for grid voltage and inverter power registers. If you own a SMILE-B3 or SMILE-B3-PLUS, select that variant after installation.

## Entities

### Sensors (read-only)

103 sensors are enabled by default; the remaining 69 are disabled and can be turned on individually in HA under Settings → Devices & Services → [device] → entities. Sensors marked *(disabled)* below are off by default.

#### Power (real-time)

These sensors have a 1 s `scan_interval` but the master loop runs at 2 s in Normal mode, so the effective update rate is 2 s by default. Selecting Fast mode reduces the loop to 1 s, achieving the full 1 s rate.

#### Changing Dispatch Parameters While Running

You can adjust Power, SoC target, or Duration for an active Force Charging, Force Discharging, Force Export, or Force Import session without toggling the switch:

1. Change the relevant number slider (e.g. set Duration to 120 min).

The integration immediately rewrites the dispatch registers with the updated values and restarts the countdown from the new duration. The per-mode countdown sensor reflects the change within the next 5 s poll.

---

## Network Setup

For reliable Modbus TCP connectivity:

1. Connect the inverter's **LAN port** directly to your router (or via a switch)
2. Set a **DHCP reservation** in your router so the inverter always gets the same IP
3. If your inverter is on Wi-Fi, a **powerline adapter** or **Wi-Fi repeater in bridge mode** works well

The inverter's Modbus TCP port is `502` and the slave ID is `85` by default. These can be verified in the AlphaESS app under **Settings → Communication**.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Integration won't connect**
- Confirm the inverter IP is reachable: try `ping <inverter-ip>` from your HA host
- Check that Modbus TCP is enabled on the inverter (AlphaESS app → Settings → Communication)
- Make sure no firewall is blocking port 502
- AlphaESS inverters only allow **one Modbus TCP connection at a time** - if another app (a second HA instance, a Modbus tool, Alpha2MQTT, etc.) is already connected, HA will be refused. Disconnect the other client and reload the integration

**Entities show unavailable after some time**
- This can happen if the inverter goes into sleep/standby mode at night - it recovers automatically when the inverter wakes up
- Check HA logs for Modbus timeout errors

**Force charging / dispatch not working**
- Only one dispatch mode can be active at a time - activating one switch will deactivate any other active switch
- Dispatch automatically resets after the configured duration expires

## Advanced: Writing Registers Directly

The `alphaess_modbus.write_register` service writes a raw integer value to any Modbus holding register using FC6 (Write Single Register). It is intended for use from Developer Tools or automations by advanced users and developers.

> **Warning:** Writing incorrect values to grid safety registers (overvoltage, undervoltage, frequency protection) or inverter configuration registers can cause the inverter to trip or behave unexpectedly. Use with care and consult the AlphaESS Modbus register documentation before writing to any register you are not certain about. This service is for developers only.

```yaml
service: alphaess_modbus.write_register
data:
  address: 2052    # register address as a decimal integer (hex: 0x0804)
  value: 400       # raw integer to write (no scale or offset applied)
```

The address must be provided as a decimal integer. Convert hex addresses from the register documentation using a calculator (for example, 0x0804 = 2052). The value is written as-is with no scale or offset applied.

If two inverters are configured, the service writes the same value to all instances.

## Dashboards

Example Lovelace dashboard configurations are included in the [`examples/`](examples/) folder:

| File | Description | Custom cards required |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `alphaess_dashboard_pfcp.yaml` | Sections-layout dashboard with live power flow diagram - battery controls, scheduling, dispatch, energy stats, system info | [power-flow-card-plus](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus) |
| `alphaess_dashboard.yaml` | Sections-layout dashboard without custom cards - gauge + glance live view, battery controls, scheduling, dispatch, energy stats, system info | None |
| `power_diagram.yaml` | Power flow chart for today | [ApexCharts Card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card) |
| `power_diagram_extended.yaml` | Extended power diagrams - today, yesterday, 3-day, string detail, instant, and hi-res views | [ApexCharts Card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card) |

### How to use

1. Install any required custom cards via HACS (see table above):
   - **power-flow-card-plus**: HACS → Frontend → search "Power Flow Card Plus" → Download
   - **ApexCharts Card**: HACS → Frontend → search "ApexCharts Card" → Download
2. In Home Assistant go to **Settings → Dashboards → Add Dashboard**
3. Open the view you want to replace, click the three-dot menu → **Edit in YAML**, and paste the contents of the example file directly (the file starts with `title:` - no extra wrapping needed).

4. Reload the dashboard browser tab after installing any custom cards

> **EV Charger entity:** `alphaess_dashboard_pfcp.yaml` includes `sensor.charger_power_active_import` in the power flow diagram. If you do not have an EV charger, remove the `individual:` block from the `custom:power-flow-card-plus` card.

> All entity IDs follow the pattern `sensor.alphaess_inverter_*`, `switch.alphaess_inverter_*`, etc. (the device name is "AlphaESS Inverter", which Home Assistant uses as the entity ID prefix).

## Changelog

### v1.15.3 — Automatic dispatch reset on HA shutdown / restart

**EN**

Previously, if Home Assistant was shut down or the integration was reloaded while a Force Export, Force Import, or Force Charging dispatch was active, the inverter kept running the last command indefinitely—until either the dispatch timer expired on the inverter side or a manual *Dispatch Reset* was triggered.

v1.15.3 adds two complementary safety hooks in `__init__.py`:

| Hook | When it fires | What it does |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| `EVENT_HOMEASSISTANT_STOP` listener | HA graceful shutdown | Sends dispatch reset before the event loop closes |
| `async_unload_entry` reset | Integration reload / HACS update / config change | Sends dispatch reset before the Modbus connection is closed |

Both hooks are guarded by `coordinator.active_dispatch_key is not None`, so they are a no-op when no dispatch is active and have zero impact on normal polling cycles.
The persistent dispatch key is also cleared so a subsequent restart does not attempt a *Sync Dispatch State* for a dispatch that was already stopped.

**DE**

Bislang lief der Wechselrichter nach einem HA-Shutdown oder Integrations-Reload weiter im zuletzt gesetzten Dispatch-Modus (Force Export, Force Import oder Force Charging) — solange, bis der interne Dispatch-Timer des Wechselrichters ablief oder manuell *Dispatch Reset* betätigt wurde.

v1.15.3 ergänzt in `__init__.py` zwei komplementäre Sicherheits-Hooks:

| Hook | Auslöser | Aktion |
|------|----------|--------|
| `EVENT_HOMEASSISTANT_STOP`-Listener | Geordneter HA-Shutdown | Sendet Dispatch-Reset vor dem Schließen des Event-Loops |
| Reset in `async_unload_entry` | Integrations-Reload / HACS-Update / Konfigurationsänderung | Sendet Dispatch-Reset vor dem Schließen der Modbus-Verbindung |

Beide Hooks prüfen `coordinator.active_dispatch_key is not None` und sind daher ein No-Op, wenn kein Dispatch aktiv ist – kein Einfluss auf normale Poll-Zyklen.
Der persistierte Dispatch-Schlüssel wird ebenfalls gelöscht, damit beim nächsten Start kein *Sync Dispatch State* für einen bereits gestoppten Dispatch versucht wird.
