## Features

- **94 sensor entities enabled by default** (160 total) — real-time power flows, battery SoC/SoH, cell voltages, temperatures, voltages, energy totals, dispatch diagnostics, grid safety parameters, faults & warnings
- **Force Charging** — charge battery from grid at configurable power (kW), duration, and cutoff SoC
- **Force Discharging** — discharge battery at configurable power, duration, and cutoff SoC; automatically stops 1% above the cutoff and resets dispatch so the inverter returns to self-consumption without any grid draw
- **Force Export** — export battery to grid at configurable power, duration, and cutoff SoC; same zero-grid-draw auto-stop as Force Discharging
- **Force Import** — import from grid at a configurable target kW, dynamically adjusting battery charge to offset live PV so total grid draw stays at the target; stops at cutoff SoC
- **Excess Export** — prioritise grid export over battery charging to reduce PV clipping
- **Smart Export** — dynamically exports up to a configurable max power, accounting for live house load and PV so grid export stays at the target without overloading the inverter
- **Battery cell health** — min/max cell voltages polled every 60 s; charge/discharge cutoff voltages, module count, capacity, and type available as diagnostic sensors
- **Dispatch diagnostics** — energy flow direction (human-readable), PV switch state, frequency dispatch flag, power, and frequency
- **SOC Calibration scheduling** — enable/disable the inverter's automatic calibration feature, set cycle mode (One-shot / Recurring), and configure the cycle interval in days
- **Charging / Discharging time periods** — configure up to two charge and discharge windows
- **Dispatch mode selector** — Battery only, SoC Control, Load Following, Maximise Output, and more
- **Max Feed to Grid** — set grid export limit as % of installed PV capacity
- **Date & Time sync** — sync inverter clock to Home Assistant system time
- **Sync Dispatch State** — reconcile HA switch states with the inverter after a restart

3. Fill in the details:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Inverter IP Address | — | Use a DHCP reservation for a stable address |
| Modbus Port | `502` | Change only if you've modified the inverter setting |
| Slave ID | `85` | Standard for AlphaESS inverters |

4. Click **Submit** — Home Assistant will test the connection before saving

## Poll Intervals

Each sensor has a fixed poll interval hardcoded in the integration. The coordinator runs a 1-second master loop and skips registers that aren't due yet.

| Interval | Sensors |
|----------|---------|
| **1 s** | Grid Power, Battery Power, Active Power PV Meter, PV String 1–4 Power, PV Total Power *(disabled by default)* |
| **5 s** | Grid Power Phase A/B/C, Grid Voltage Phase A/B/C, Inverter Work Mode, Inverter Power L1/L2/L3 + total, System Fault, Inverter Warning 1/2, Inverter Fault 1/2, Battery Warning/Fault, Max Feed to Grid, Dispatch registers (including Dispatch Energy Flow Direction, Freq Dispatch Flag), dispatch PV switch, freq dispatch power/frequency *(last two disabled by default)* |
| **10 s** | Battery SoC, Battery SoH, Battery min/max cell temps, Battery max charge/discharge current, Charging Time Period Control, Charging Cutoff SoC |
| **30 s** | Grid Frequency, Charging/Discharging period start/stop times, Discharging Cutoff SoC |
| **60 s** | Inverter Temperature, Battery Voltage/Current/Status/Remaining Time, Battery min/max cell voltages, Battery relay status *(disabled)*, PV String Voltage & Current, Energy Totals, Version strings, SOC Calibration Enable *(disabled)*, Network settings *(disabled)* |
| **300 s** | Battery charge/discharge cutoff voltages, Battery module count, Battery capacity, Battery type, SOC calibration cycle days *(all disabled by default)* |

There is no user-configurable poll interval — intervals are tuned per-sensor to balance responsiveness against the inverter's one-connection limit.

## Network Setup

For reliable Modbus TCP connectivity:

1. Connect the inverter's **LAN port** directly to your router (or via a switch)
2. Set a **DHCP reservation** in your router so the inverter always gets the same IP
3. If your inverter is on Wi-Fi, a **powerline adapter** or **Wi-Fi repeater in bridge mode** works well

The inverter's Modbus TCP port is `502` and the slave ID is `85` by default. These can be verified in the AlphaESS app under **Settings → Communication**.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Integration won't connect**
- Confirm the inverter IP is reachable: try `ping <inverter-ip>` from your HA host
- Check that Modbus TCP is enabled on the inverter (AlphaESS app → Settings → Communication)
- Make sure no firewall is blocking port 502
- AlphaESS inverters only allow **one Modbus TCP connection at a time** — if another app (a second HA instance, a Modbus tool, Alpha2MQTT, etc.) is already connected, HA will be refused. Disconnect the other client and reload the integration

**Entities show unavailable after some time**
- This can happen if the inverter goes into sleep/standby mode at night — it recovers automatically when the inverter wakes up
- Check HA logs for Modbus timeout errors

**Force charging / dispatch not working**
- Only one dispatch mode can be active at a time — activating one switch will deactivate any other active switch
- Dispatch automatically resets after the configured duration expires

## Dashboards

Example Lovelace dashboard configurations are included in the [`examples/`](examples/) folder:

| File | Description | Custom cards required |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `alphaess_dashboard_pfcp.yaml` | Sections-layout dashboard with live power flow diagram — battery controls, scheduling, dispatch, energy stats, system info | [power-flow-card-plus](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus) |
| `alphaess_dashboard.yaml` | Sections-layout dashboard without custom cards — gauge + glance live view, battery controls, scheduling, dispatch, energy stats, system info | None |
| `power_diagram.yaml` | Power flow chart for today | [ApexCharts Card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card) |
| `power_diagram_extended.yaml` | Extended power diagrams — today, yesterday, 3-day, string detail, instant, and hi-res views | [ApexCharts Card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card) |

### How to use

1. Install any required custom cards via HACS (see table above):
   - **power-flow-card-plus**: HACS → Frontend → search "Power Flow Card Plus" → Download
   - **ApexCharts Card**: HACS → Frontend → search "ApexCharts Card" → Download
2. In Home Assistant go to **Settings → Dashboards → Add Dashboard**
3. Switch to YAML mode and paste the contents of the example file

   Or use the **Raw configuration editor** on an existing dashboard to add the views — paste the content starting from the `views:` key.

4. Reload the dashboard browser tab after installing any custom cards

> **EV Charger entity:** `alphaess_dashboard_pfcp.yaml` includes `sensor.charger_power_active_import` in the power flow diagram. If you do not have an EV charger, remove the `individual:` block from the `custom:power-flow-card-plus` card.

> All entity IDs follow the pattern `sensor.alphaess_inverter_*`, `switch.alphaess_inverter_*`, etc. (the device name is "AlphaESS Inverter", which Home Assistant uses as the entity ID prefix).

## Changelog

### v1.7.2
- **fix:** remove SOC calibration scheduling entities (SOC Calibration switch, SOC Calibration Enable switch, SOC Calibration Cycle Mode select, SOC Calibration Cycle Days number) - registers 0x1900-0x1903 return Illegal Data Address on current inverter firmware; the read-only Battery SOC Calibration status sensor at 0x012F remains. Use a Home Assistant automation to trigger a calibration cycle via the AlphaESS app or inverter web UI instead.

### v1.7.1
- **fix:** single-register writes (selects, numbers, buttons, time entities) were using Modbus FC16 (Write Multiple Registers) instead of FC6 (Write Single Register). Many AlphaESS inverters reject FC16 for individual registers with exception code 2 (Illegal Data Address). All single-register writes now correctly use FC6. Dispatch block writes (9 registers at 0x0880) remain on FC16.

### v1.7.0
- **feat:** 18 new entities - battery health (SoH, cell voltages, cell temps, relay status, module count, capacity), dispatch diagnostics (energy flow direction, freq dispatch flag and power/frequency setpoints), and SOC calibration scheduling (enable switch, trigger switch, cycle mode select, cycle days number)

### v1.6.5
- **feat:** Force Charging Hold and Force Import Hold switches - hold the inverter in force-charge or force-import mode indefinitely without a dispatch timeout

### v1.6.4
- **fix:** force discharge and force export now stop 1% above the SOC cutoff to guarantee zero grid draw on the GloBird ZeroHero plan (previously the inverter could briefly draw from grid as SoC hit the limit)

### v1.6.3
- **fix:** add SOC watcher to stop force discharging/export immediately when cutoff SoC is reached

### v1.6.2
- **fix:** use 60 s refresh loop for force discharging/export to guarantee dispatch reset on SOC cutoff

### v1.6.1
- **fix:** stop force discharge/charge/export immediately when SOC cutoff is reached

### v1.6.0
- **feat:** add Force Import switch, replace Smart Charge
